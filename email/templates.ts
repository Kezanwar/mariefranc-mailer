          <p>Hello!</p>
          
          <p>I'm excited to share the press release for Marie Franc's upcoming single, 'Leave The Light On', set for release on 22nd August.</p>
          
          <p>This track is the band's second single of the year and the second release from their debut EP Saturday Boy, following an early spin on BBC Introducing Manchester. 'Leave The Light On' blends dream pop and soul-tinged indie, with sultry guitar textures and emotionally rich vocals that create an intimate, evocative sound.</p>
          
          <p>Marie Franc is gaining momentum, with a sold-out headline show and a main stage performance at Moovin Festival alongside Ezra Collective. More live dates are coming this autumn.</p>
